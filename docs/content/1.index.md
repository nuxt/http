The HTTP module for [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) provides a universal way to make HTTP requests to any API.

It uses [ky-universal](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky-universal) and [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to make HTTP requests. Please see the [migration guide](/migration-guides/migration) if you are currently using axios module and wish to migrate.

Starting from [v2.5.0](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.5.0), Nuxt.js has built-in support for universal fetch. However, this module provides several advantages.

> This module is an alternative to the [Axios module](https://axios.nuxtjs.org).
